## How to Get Involved

The GitOps Working Group is an open group, inviting companies and individuals to join and contribute to the community and the adoption of GitOps across the cloud native landscape.
There are a few ways you can get involved:

- Watch or star [OpenGitOps project repos](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/blob/main/README.md#repositories) and [GitOps Working Group](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group/) repo to see when things change
- Join the [GitOps Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GitOps/)
- Attend a [Working Group or Committee meeting](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group/blob/main/MEETINGS.md)
- Start or participate in [Discussions](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions)
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/issues) and let us know how you're using GitOps and any important considerations we should include
- Join `#wg-gitops` on [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/)
- Join the [SIG App Delivery](https://github.com/cncf/sig-app-delivery) mailing list, and watch or participate in topics prefixed with `[gitops-wg]`
- See [Working Group project boards](https://github.com/orgs/gitops-working-group/projects) for status of work, or for ideas on areas that could use additional participation
